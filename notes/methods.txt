Processed outputs for BM03 TCR study. All files are generated by MixCR v4.6.0-226-devel except for Adaptive outputs which were produced by their internal processing. 

As of 10/18/24 the adaptive data has not yet been downsampled. 

RNA data has been downsampled to the lowest READ (not UMI) count per sample for that input. There are 2 input levels, large and small, reflecting the starting material used.

The C2-F2SB sample was removed due to poor data recovery from sequencer.

Sequencing data was processed with MixCR 4.6.0-226-devel. Parameters for each
sample were selected based on available information from the product information 
for each kit, as well as documentation provided by MixCR on similar kits/vendors.

For all kits, MixCR alignment was ran with the following flags:

```
-p generic-amplicon-with-umi 
--species hsa 
--rna 
```
Alignment boundaries and tag-pattern were adjusted as needed per kit.

Takara:
--tag-pattern "^N{7}(R1:*) \ ^(UMI:N{12})N{7}(R2:*)" \
--rigid-left-alignment-boundary \
--floating-right-alignment-boundary C \
Qiaseq:
--tag-pattern "^(R1:*) \ ^(UMI:N{18})N{12}(R2:*)" \
--rigid-left-alignment-boundary \
--floating-right-alignment-boundary C \
NEB:
--tag-pattern "^N{22}(R1:*) \ ^(UMI:N{17})N{7}(R2:*)" \
--rigid-left-alignment-boundary \
--floating-right-alignment-boundary C \
Cellecta:
--tag-pattern "^(R1:*)\^(UMI:N{18})(R2:*)" \
--floating-left-alignment-boundary \
--floating-right-alignment-boundary C \

After `mixcr align`, `refineTagsAndSort` was ran. Next, we ran `mixcr assemble`
with the following flags:

```
-OassemblingFeatures="CDR3" 
-OseparateByJ=true
-OseparateByV=true
```

I followed the MixCR guidelines for setting -OseparateByC=true on a per-kit basis. In hindsight, I should probably
have kept this consistent for each kit. It may warrant rerunning. Currently it was set to true for takara and neb
and false for qiaseq and cellecta.
